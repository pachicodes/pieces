title: "In truth and in delusion"
---

Every day we are closer to the end
And you don’t know that.
Now that I see it, the end actually happened long ago…
But you can’t see it now.

Do you see how we live our lives?
We are together but we are alone.
And I grew quite tired of being alone together.
It is an illusion… A delusion.

The truth… I don’t know what it is
But I know it is not us.
Maybe we loved each other, but we are not in love.
We are just in life... 

Our story is not ugly
It is just over...
We have good things to remember.
We have good feelings to keep.

Let’s end this while we have this goodness to keepsake. 
While we have respect.
You will always be dear to my heart,
Even though right now I know it doesn't matter.
