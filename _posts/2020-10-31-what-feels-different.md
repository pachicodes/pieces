title:  "What feels different"

Things are different.
Not that she could quite put her finger on the whats, hows, and whys. 
All she had was this feeling in her gut. It made her want to puke and scream at the same time.
Yet, looking around, all looked the same.

She could swear that the air seemed fresher and the birds sounded louder. Also, all the people seemed either anxious or depressed, or both. And the doctor had no issue issuing medications for those ailments.  She gave up and today took the anxiety drug the doctor had given her. What was the point in fighting anyway? All was so off.

Physically all was fine, here and there… But the feelings. Oh, the feeling told a whole different tale, one of doom and despair. All souls were lost and didn’t even know about it. But maybe, ignorance was a blessing after all?

Oh yes, ignorance sounded like a bliss right about now. But even if her brain couldn’t figure out the data, facts and logic, the feelings in her chest were all-knowing.
