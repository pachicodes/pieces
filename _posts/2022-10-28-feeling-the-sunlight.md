About the feeling of the Sunlight

Once more I sit here,
Pondering on what to say to myself.
What poetry could come out of this numb soul, I wonder?
But all I can feel is the Sunlight, sneaking into the room
Caressing my face.

It is always a gentle reminder of all things,
Good things and bad things,
Things I have done and things I must do.
The reminder is only one, but for all.
For all the things I have in mind.

Now, what if I decide to do nothing at all?
Total inertia. Then what of me?
Then I would just not be?
That sounds like a faint notion of heaven to me,
	The not be.
