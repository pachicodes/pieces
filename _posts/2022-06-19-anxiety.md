title:  "Anxiety"
---


There are too many nameless feelings being felt in this soul

I am not sure where they come from


I don’t know why they are
All I know is that it has been consuming my being

And I don’t like it



But  I guess it is like that with feelings

They have names, but they cannot be properly described

Everyone feels them differently

Anxiety is what I am calling this one 

And I don’t like it



It has this annoying power of taking the peace away


It always takes the joy and the focus


It turns my heart into a ball of uncomfortable feelings


It makes it hard to have control over my mental and emotional


And I don’t like it


But my likes or dislikes or wantings 

It just is
Everyday
Somedays
When it is
