title:  "About the life, you don't want to live"
---

As I sit here trying to do what I have to get done, 
I can’t help but feel a certain level of desperation in my chest. 
It is suffocating. 

There is a time in life when we decide things. 
Most of us decide on the practical, the path we know is possible. 
The logical one. 
Yet, sometimes I feel like this decision is killing me slowly. 
So slowly in fact, that most of the days I don’t even realize that there is an issue at all.
But not today. 
Today I feel suffocated. Not in my lungs, but in my heart.
 
When I was younger I thought heartbreak was bad but compared to this… 
I would like a heartbreak right now. 
Maybe I would feel anything more than this nameless desperation.

Of course, the life that I would want to live isn’t attainable. 
I knew it from the get-go, and that is the way I made the choices I made. 
Am I the only one who dies every day and still is alive somehow? 
Do you die too?

But there is no choice there other than to live.
And I am living. 
Begging the nameless numbness to go away.
Go away for a little while at least,
Because I know within myself that it will never leave me for good.

But for now,
I shall live.
The life I don’t want.
