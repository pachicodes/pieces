title:  "One more time, she didn’t feel"
---

One more time, she didn’t feel it. No good nor bad.
She just sat there, looking at the nothing, wondering if all this emptiness was ok. 
Not that she cared really.

She was too lost to care.
Maybe some pain would help? She thought she wanted some.
But she didn’t want anything enough to make her move.

The fog was ok.
It wasn't pleasing. But it wasn't unpleasant either. It was just… foggy.
While her feelings were gone, her thoughts swam in her mind like fish. But she just sat there and observed that too.

She did long for an escape from her mind. She just didn’t know how to run from that.
