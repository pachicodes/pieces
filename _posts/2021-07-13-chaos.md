title:  "Chaos"
---

Days and nights.
Up and downs.
Emptiness and fulfillment.
All in one place.

This is chaos.

There is no good or bad.
There is no beauty or ugly.
There is just raw truth and rough pain.

And this is chaos.

Your feelings may be all over the place, but they are yours.
Your thoughts, your decisions, your steps. 
They are all yours. 

This chaos is yours.

Now, I repeat:  There is no good or bad.
Just the feeling that you have to sit with. 
And accept.

Accept your chaos.
