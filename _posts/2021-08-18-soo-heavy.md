title:  "Soo heavy"
---

I am tired… It is soo heavy.
I feel soo heavy. On the inside. 
On the outside, I feel like this giant hand is pushing me down. 
Like gravity, but not in the body. In the soul.

This grief. I can’t explain it. 
I know it makes sense in a way, my therapist did tell me about that.
But it is soo heavy.
I want to close my eyes and be gone. But not forever.

Just for a little while, I would like to cease existing.
Living is hard. It is worth it, but it is hard anyway.
I knew there would be a storm, even when I could see the rainbow right after it.
I was ready for all of this…

But still, it is heavy.
