title:  "Snowflake"

She didn’t really know where she was going, but she couldn’t stop walking. Not now.
She felt like if she stopped now, she would be lost in the depths of her thoughts. Thoughts that she had been avoiding, denying, and ignoring.
She preferred the numbness rather than the pain. 
The emptiness was welcomed. Why did she have to feel anything at all? No, that wasn’t necessary.
So she just kept walking. 
It was the end of January, and the frosty wind kissed her cheeks making her face numb. She liked numb. She wondered if she could be all numb. Oh, the bliss that it would be to cease existing right now. She watched as snow started to fall, and right there she decided she wanted to be a snowflake. Its existence is beautiful, yet short. So, the snowflake wasn’t anymore.
But she still was. How long had she to?
