title:  "There is nothing to"
---


It really comes as a surprise to me that within the emptiness of my soul, I can still write.
Have you ever longed for pain?
Deep, reassuring, and alive…
I want to feel alive.

But I feel empty.
All I want is out of my reach.
What I want is for once, to let someone take care of me.
But who can do it the way I need, when I am soo peculiar?

So I am alone.
It is not anyone’s fault, it is just our situation
It shall change soon enough.
But soon enough?

I wish I could cry.
That ugly, heavy cry that cleans your soul.
But nothing comes out.
There is nothing to.
