title:  "What one longs for"
---

Sometimes I miss the city life. 
The lights, the movement, the people I will never know.
The noise that becomes your silence.
I miss being alone with myself.

I am not sure how I feel about feeling this way.
I can do whatever I want with my life, but at the same time, I can’t.
Choices were made, people are involved, and once more, I put myself in a place to long for freedom,
True freedom. What does this even mean?

Why do I keep being soo mean to myself while being afraid of being mean to others?
I am not even sure what is this freedom that I long for. 
What do I long for? Maybe it would be best to answer this before going on making more choices…
Involving more people. 

But do we ever know truly what we want?
Are we even equipped to know this?
The one thing that is constant in my mind is how I have to be real to myself.
In the end, that is the minimum I own to my soul.
